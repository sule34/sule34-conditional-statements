For this assignment you should read the task, then below the task do what it asks you to do.
'''

'''
#1) Create a Variable called grade and set it to an integer. Make an if statement that checks if the grade is a passing grade. grade must be above 65 to pass. print out "student is passing"
'''
grade =70
if (grade == 70)
print("student is passing")
'''
#2) Now make an if, else statement that checks if the student is passing but also print "student is failing", if the grade is less than 65
'''
grade = 70
if (grade == 70 and grade == 55)
print("student is passing")
else(grade == 55)
print ("student is failing")
'''
#3)Create a variable called age. Make and if, else statement that checks if the age entered is old enough to vote. Remember the voting age is 18
'''
age = 18
if (age == 18 and age == 17)
print("can vote")
else (age == 17)
print ("cannot vote")
'''
#4)Create a variable called weight. Make an if statement that checks the unit of the weight. If the weight is in kilograms, convert it to pounds 
'''
weight = "4lbs"
pattern = "^[0-9]+lbs=$"
    if weightMatch:
weight = weight.replace(patter,weight)
weight = weight.replace("lbs")
weight =int(weight)/2.205
weight = str(weight) + "kas"
print (weight)
    else:
        weight = weight.replace("kas")
        weight = int(weight)*2.205
        weight = str(weight) + "lbs"
        print(weight)
'''
#5)Now modify the previous program to also convert from pounds to kilograms
'''
x = weight
if (x == weight and x == kilograms)
print ("pounds")
